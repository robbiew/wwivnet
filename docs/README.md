# Code of Conduct

This section *only* pertains to traffic that passes through the network 
WWIVnet. It claims no scope or authority over messages or activity that 
does not enter the network.

Each SYSOP is responsible for the actions and messages of any user 
originating from thier system when those messages enter WWIVnet. If 
any SYSOP allows traffic to enter the WWIVnet via their system (e.g. from 
a program, gateway, or other source), that SYSOP is responsible for that 
traffic. 

Permitting the following traffic over the network can result in disciplinary 
action, including but not limited to expulsion of the system from WWIVnet:

* Illegal activity, defined as engaging in conduct that a reasonable person 
would deem that violates applicable federal, state, local, or international 
law or regulation. When a question of locality is in question, the locality 
shall be the physical location of 1@1.

* Harmful code, defined as code that may be deemed harmful, dangerous, or 
destructive in any manner. An exception is made for *clearly labeled* 
samples for forensic and educational purposes, where significant action 
must be taken by a user to activate the payload.

* Other activities that may harm WWIVnet, as determined by 1@1 and the 
collective SYSOPs of WWIVnet.

# Notes about WWIVnet-FTN

- The WWIVnet-FTN hub is running D'Bridge.  D'Bridge uses the same
  password for ```Binkp Session Password``` as the 
  ```Packet Password```. I can make them different, but when a 
  Session Password is set - it will also set the Packet Password
  (will use the same PW).
- The destination BinkP port for my D'Bridge hub is ```24555```
  (as noted in the Nodelist).
- The Current Nodelist is available from:
  [https://github.com/wwivbbs/wwivnet/tree/master/wwivnet](https://github.com/wwivbbs/wwivnet/tree/master/wwivnet)
- Please use wwivftn for the domain name when creating the network to
  avoid MD5 CRAM session PW issues.
- To submit the application, please log into my BBS 
  (bbs.weather-station.org) and email me the application or 
  Internet email to:
  [mark@weather-station.org](mailto:mark@weather-station.org)
